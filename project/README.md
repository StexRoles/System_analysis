# Chatbot Health and Wellness

The idea is to create a personal virtual assistant to manage your personal management knowledge system. So, you should choose a topic of interest, do a system analysis around this topic, showing this as complexity, components, relationships, chaos, anything you consider relevant to understanding the topic as a complete system.

My chosen topic is health and well-being, since I find it interesting that you can have an assistant who can help people by giving health and personal care recommendations.

# System Scope

First I am going to establish the scope of my system, health is an extremely enormous system and of vital importance for humans, in addition to being so large there is a great probability that there will be chaos that alters this system and affects people, The problem is that these errors can cost human lives. Due to the above, the system will be limited only to disease prevention, we will divide this into two subsystems that would be; preventable diseases and recommendations for a healthy life.

# Information sources

As already mentioned, the purpose is to train a chatbot that answers questions according to the topic we chose, so here comes a very important factor and that is the collection of information. Below we will mention the information formats that could be used and why. than its use.

The most common formats are PDF files, wikis, websites, forums. Starting with PDF files, the main problem with this format is that their contents do not vary, so the information collected by them may be outdated, especially in a field such as health, which can change constantly. Wikis and forums have a common problem and that is that the veracity of the information cannot be guaranteed, for this reason false information could be obtained quite easily, since not only is the information false, but we can also obtain incomplete information. or information that although it is believed to be a joke, artificial intelligence cannot differentiate it.

So in this case, mainly in the health system, the source of information used are websites of recognized health entities, such as the Red Cross, and since there is a reliable entity, most of the information should be truthful and reliable.

# Ethical operation

A very important issue enters this system, which is health ethics, "Should human health be left in the hands of a computer?" For this reason, we also limit our system to only disease prevention and this should not replace the review of a professional doctor, it would only help a person to know and use healthy habits that can help reduce the risk of suffering. diseases.

# Simulation

To test that our assistant meets what we need without negatively affecting what we have already proposed, we can carry out several simulations to check that it works correctly, as they can; ask as a completely healthy patient, then changing to a patient with symptoms of mild illnesses and finally as a patient with a more serious illness.
The output we expect from these simulations would be to obtain coherent responses depending on the patient, in addition to not obtaining information that could negatively affect health, such as generating self-medication, as well as not obtaining false or irrelevant information.

# Interaction and synergy

In our system we have two key subsystems, recommendations and diseases, both are separate but at the same time they go hand in hand, since the recommendations can be to prevent several diseases or one specific one, at the same time that the diseases have their own recommendations that prevent such a disease, therefore both subsystems are interrelated to be able to get what we need in our assistant.
