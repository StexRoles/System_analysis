## PURPOSE
The purpose of my expert system is that it allows people to find the title of a movie that they have seen and don't remember the name of the title or that they have heard that the movie is very good but still don't remember the name of the movie.

## ANALYSIS
Now analyzing my system, as said before, the purpose is to be able to find the title of the movie you want to find. To achieve this, we are going to ask the other data that we have available, such as the year, the genre and the actors. that could be in the movie.

Starting with the first question is to know if you know the genre since it is usually what people memorize the most or they can get an idea knowing some details of the movie, for example, if I know that a movie uses firearms, most likely it is Let it be an action movie.

Now the entropy that I can find in my system is the fact that there are people who really don't know anything about your movie, in this case it will be necessary to inform that some data is required in which we have available.
